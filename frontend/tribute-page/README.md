# Build a Tribute Page

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

* User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

## Notes

First steps:

* Created a project on this github repo to track tasks and entered in the tasks associated with finishing the Tribute Page to the project, updated them all to issues so I could commit against them
* Picked a topic ([Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy))
* Mocked up the interfece in [Pencil](https://github.com/evolus/pencil/releases)
* Made my stack choice Angular 2 / Node.js / Scss / D3.js
