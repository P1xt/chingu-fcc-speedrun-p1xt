# Build a Camper Leaderboard

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

* User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

* User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

**Hint:** To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.

**Hint:** To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.
